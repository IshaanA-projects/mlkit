  ### preprocessing
  A group of functions for scaling data
  ### model_selection
  Functions for splitting data into train and test sets

## linear_model   
  A group of models that use algorithms that find linear relationships between variables   
  Includes:   
  ### LinearRegression
  Finds the line of best fit. Currently only works in 2d
## neighbours
  A group of modes that used nearest neighbours type algorithms   
  Includes:   
  ### KNN
